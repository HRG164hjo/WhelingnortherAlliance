This branch of Whelingnorther Alliance have settled on this rimworld for a long time. Although they appear to be peaceful at the moment, they have undoubtedly had plenty of violent conflicts with other factions on the planet. Recently they seem to be becoming active again and preparing to achieve their ultimate goal - the Whelingnorther Apocalypse.

No great works can be done without great sacrifices, without great devotions we cannot achieve eternity, salvation and immortality. We descendants will follow the path led by those who came before us; we will understand our duty and accept our manifest destiny; we shall alter and determine the past, the present and the future. Every corner of existance shall bath in the glory of Whelignorther, they may not understand, but they shall obey and follow. -->
